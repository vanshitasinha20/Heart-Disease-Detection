❤️ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on health parameters using machine learning.

📌 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can help in effective treatment. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict heart disease using health-related features.
