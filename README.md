# ❤️ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have **heart disease** based on medical parameters using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
**Early detection** can play a vital role in effective treatment and prevention.  

In this project, we build and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.
